Release 0.5.0 - 20 Nov 2013
===========================================================================

This is the initial release of Mantle Business Artifacts (version 0.5.0).
It is based on Moqui Framework 1.3.2. This version covers procure to pay,
order to cash, and work plan to cash processes including:

- Purchase and Sales Orders (for goods, services, materials, etc; POs for
  inventory and equipment/supplies/etc)
- Project, Task, and Request management with time and expense recording,
  billable/payable rates by project/task/client/worker/etc
- Incoming and Outgoing Invoices with a wide variety of item types and an
  XSL:FO template for print or email
- Automatic invoice generation for purchase orders (AP), sales orders (AR),
  project client time and expenses (AR), project vendor/worker time and
  expenses (AP)
- Payments, both manually recorded and automatic through payment processing
  interfaces; applying payments to invoices
- Fulfillment of sales orders (including basic picking and packing) and
  receiving of purchase orders
- Inventory management including issuance and receipt, and inventory
  reservation for sales orders
- Automated GL account posting of incoming and outgoing invoices, outgoing
  and incoming payments, payment application, and inventory receipt and
  issuance
- General GL functionality for time periods, validation of transactions to
  post, time period closing
- Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports (and basic posted amounts and
  account balance by time period summaries)

The automated tests are a great example of functionality and a good
reference for where data ends up. They include complete flows with service
calls and data validation for purchase orders (procure to pay), sales
orders (order to cash), and billable projects with client and vendor/worker
invoice/payment (work plan to cash).
