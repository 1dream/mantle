TODO:

- Make prefixes consistent (no suffixes), ie toPartyId instead of partyIdTo, etc
- Change all relationships to PartyRole to be type one-nofk; use plain one for Party and RoleType
- Move most *Type entities to Enumeration values (update seed data, referring
  entities, remove *Type) (after this remove all remaining hasTable fields)
- Rework PhysicalInventory and InventoryVariance to simplify, reduce dependency on InventoryItem
- Remove all references to Survey, Content, etc (maybe point to a contentLocation)
- Review use of Appl, Assoc (look at book, make sure consistent)
- Cleanup/reorg ProductStoreShipmentMeth, ShipmentCostEstimate, etc (maybe change to the rule condition/action pattern?)
- Change TaxAuthority to single pk for easier fks
- Get rid of NoteData, put directly on various *Note entities
- Get rid of (and replace as needed) TemporalExpression
- Review all entities with large PKs (esp 4+ fields)
- Review all UserLogin, move to UserAccount or eliminate reference
- Review and do something with all createOn/By lastUpdateOn/By fields, maybe add an auditing flag for the entity
  instead of just for a field
- Redo Accommodation* entities based on travel industry model in book 2
- Invoice handle recurrence? (was using RecurrenceInfo)
- Remove all createdDate, createdByUserLogin, lastModifiedDate, lastModifiedByUserLogin fields (use framework defaults, audit-log)
- Trim down big entities like Product, WorkEffort, etc; for groups of similar fields use a more normalized structure
- S/R for field types across all files
